# Summary
* This is my caffee-fueled testing project completion of a coffeeMaker software provided by Coursera Software Testing Automoation specialization.

* In this project, I tried to crush 2 assignment in a week. Spent 8 hours on the weekend to finish one assignment and the next.

* In this project I use cucumber behaviour-driven development and use Jacoco Coverage Report for the software. it covers 185 test cases with the testing codebase spanning around 600 lines of code.

* One thing I learn from this project is coverage testing is a fantastic way to discover any tiny bugs in your white-box code.

* Another thing I learn from this 24 hours intense project experience is that being a serious software engineer requires you to sit there for 8 or even 12 hours everyday debugging the code and try to discover any small detail of the software. Also, the behavioural way of given..when..and then is a great way to test software.

# The hardest part
* The hardest part is testing the cases one by one finding out which one fail the correct version of the software. And when the project is almost done, polishing the software and having the discipline to go through it and not giving up really tests your drive.

# About journaling for code is good for your soul
* Debugging and polishing by yourself is probably the most tedious and lonliest task you have to do as a software engineer.

# Whenever you do test driven development

* compile and read test result
* breakpoint and debug
* submit and read error 
* read tracestack
* rinse and repeat

* IMPORTANT: Whenever you there is a bit list of  test you need to do, don't think you can skip in 2 instead of one by one. No, it's slower
